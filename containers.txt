Containers are completely isolated env.
As they have their own processes or services, their own network interfaces, their own mounts just like VM,
Except they all share the same OS kernel.


Docker utilizes LXC containers.
Setting up these containers environment is hared as they are very low level, that is where docker offer high level tool with several powerful functionality.

Docker can run any flavor of OS on top it as log as they all based on same kernel.
(if the underlying OS is UBUNTU - Docker can run container based on another disribution like Debian, Fedora, SUSE)
